## üå≥ Cases of Unbalancing in AVL Tree

The following cases of unbalancing occur based on the side of insertion:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **LL Case (Left-Left)**  
- **Condition**: A node is inserted into the left side of the left child of the unbalanced node.  
- **Fix**: Perform a **right rotation** with respect to the unbalanced node (root node / top node). 

#### Example:
```
Before Rotation                                After Right Rotation

     30                                                20
    /                                                 /  \
  20                                                10    30
 /
10
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **RR Case (Right-Right)**  
- **Condition**: A node is inserted into the right side of the right child of the unbalanced node.  
- **Fix**: Perform a **left rotation** with respect to the unbalanced node (root node / top node).  

#### Example:
```
Before Rotation                             After Left Rotation
              
 10                                                20
   \                                              /  \
    20                                           10   30
      \
       30
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **LR Case (Left-Right)**  
- **Condition**: A node is inserted into the right side of the left child of the unbalanced node.  
- **Fix**:  
  1. Perform a **left rotation** with respect to the left child of the unbalanced node.  
  2. Perform a **right rotation** with respect to the unbalanced node (root node / top node).  

#### Example:
```
Before Rotation                           1. After Left Rotation                           2. After Right Rotation

   30                                              30                                                 20
  /                                               /                                                  /   \
10                                               20                                                10     30
  \                                             /
   20                                         10

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **RL Case (Right-Left)**  
- **Condition**: A node is inserted into the left side of the right child of the unbalanced node.  
- **Fix**:  
  1. Perform a **right rotation** with respect to the right child of the unbalanced node.  
  2. Perform a **left rotation** with respect to the unbalanced node (root node / top node).  

#### Example:
```
Before Rotation                           1. After Right Rotation                           2. After Left Rotation

10                                                10                                                   20

## üîç Determining the Case of Unbalancing

To identify which case of unbalancing has occurred for any node:

### 1. **Balance Factor > 1**
- The node is unbalanced from the **left side**.
- Check the side of insertion from the left child:
  1. **Key < rootNode->left->data** ‚Üí **LL Case**
  2. **Key > rootNode->left->data** ‚Üí **LR Case**

### 2. **Balance Factor < -1**
- The node is unbalanced from the **right side**.
- Check the side of insertion from the right child:
  1. **Key > rootNode->right->data** ‚Üí **RR Case**
  2. **Key < rootNode->right->data** ‚Üí **RL Case**

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity of AVL Tree Operations

### Worst-Case Scenario:
- The **maximum depth** of an AVL tree is **Log‚ÇÇ(N)**.
- Operations like **insertion**, **deletion**, and **searching** may require traversing to the deepest node.
- Since the maximum depth is **Log‚ÇÇ(N)**, the **time complexity** for these operations is also **Log‚ÇÇ(N)**.

### Key Insight:
- The time complexity directly depends on the maximum depth of the AVL tree.
