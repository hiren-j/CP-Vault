**📚 Fenwick Tree Notes - From Beginner to Advanced! 🌱**

I’ve never created notes for DSA, but today, as I opened my favorite notebook containing **notes on Fenwick Tree only**, I realized I had created detailed notes on it a year ago. I thought, why not share them with you all? 🚀 These notes are perfect for anyone new to **ADSA** or **Competitive Programming (CP)** and anyone who simply wants to **revise. 🧠✨**

I’ve always loved learning from documentation. I remember reading docs from **HackerEarth** and **GeeksforGeeks** for Fenwick Tree, and created these notes by considering **each and every detail required** on a Fenwick Tree. 💡

**🔹 Why is this helpful?**

Step-by-step, from **intuition building with basics to everything**, covering everything from basic concepts to **BIT operations** in an easy and **diagrammatic way** with **examples 💡**
Designed for **beginners**, but covers **everything** you need to know about **Fenwick Trees** – from the ground up to advanced techniques 💡
Ideal for anyone looking to **revise** or **solidify** their knowledge 🔄
Multiple ways to create the **Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) 🛠️**
Includes **diagrammatic explanations** to make everything **crystal clear 🎨**
**Can you find log base 2 of any value within seconds?** If you can't, then you will learn it in these notes! ⏱️
**💡 I guarantee you will find it helpful, and you’ll learn something new, like the cool log base 2 trick! 🚀 Try it out!**
